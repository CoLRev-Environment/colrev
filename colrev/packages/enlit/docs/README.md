## Summary

ENLIT is a tool that supports scholars in exploring new literature:

- It makes **backward searches more efficient** by extracting the references from a literature corpus (set of PDFs) and providing a list without duplicates. It also provides statistics on journals and authors that are cited frequently by the given literature corpus.
- It implements a **new exploratory strategy that facilitates understanding**: simply start by reading the most influential papers and skim the remaining papers afterwards. A paper that explains why this strategy is more effective than the traditional skim first and read afterwards approach will be published soon.
