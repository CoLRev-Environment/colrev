## Summary

## prescreen

This package uses a predefined scope to apply prescreening decisions automatically. For example, papers can be excluded based on the date of publication or their language. There are two use main use cases:

1. The Scope Prescreen runs before a manual prescreen. In this case, papers are either marked as `rev_prescreen_excluded`, or remain `md_processed`. Afterwards, all papers in `md_processed` are prescreened manually based on their topic.
2. The Scope Prescreen is the only prescreen package activated in the settings. In this case, papers are marked as `rev_prescreen_excluded` or `rev_prescreen_included`. Fully automated prescreening may not be appropriate for all types of reviews.

The Scope Prescreen can be added as follows:

```
colrev prescreen -a colrev.scope_prescreen -p "TimeScopeFrom=2010"
colrev prescreen -a colrev.scope_prescreen -p "TimeScopeTo=2020"
colrev prescreen -a colrev.scope_prescreen -p "LanguageScope=eng,deu"
colrev prescreen -a colrev.scope_prescreen -p "ExcludeComplementaryMaterials=True"
colrev prescreen -a colrev.scope_prescreen -p "ENTRYTYPEScope=article,inproceedings"
colrev prescreen -a colrev.scope_prescreen -p "RequireRankedJournals=True"

# TODO : OutletInclusionScope,OutletExclusionScope

```

For **RequireRankedJournals**:

- Prerequisite: The endpoint colrev.add_journal_ranking in the settings of prep must be installed.
  "colrev prep" must have been executed and `journal_ranking` must be included in metadata.
- Description: Use case: User is able to decide whether journals, which are not included in any ranking, will be marked as "rev_prescreen_included" or as "rev_prescreen_excluded".
