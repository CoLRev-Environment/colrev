In the ``colrev screen`` operation, records transition from ``pdf_prepared`` to ``rev_included`` or ``rev_excluded``. Decisions on individual screening criteria (if any) are reported in the ``screening_criteria`` field.
The order of screening is defined in the settings file.
Typically, automated screening packages are applied first, followed by manual screening.

The selection of screening criteria is recorded when initializing the screen.

.. code:: bash

	colrev screen [options]

    # Add the abstracts from the PDF files (the TEIs generated by GROBID)
    colrev screen --add_abstracts_from_tei

    # Include all papers
    colrev screen --include_all

    # Splits the screen between n researchers. Simply share the output with the researchers and ask them to run the commands in their local CoLRev project.
    colrev screen --create_split INT

    # Complete the screen for the specified split.
    colrev screen --split STR


The following options for ``screen`` are available:

.. datatemplate:json:: ../package_endpoints.json

    {{ make_list_table_from_mappings(
        [("Identifier", "package_endpoint_identifier"), ("Screen packages", "short_description"), ("Status", "status")],
        data['screen'],
        title='',
        columns=[25,55,20]
        ) }}
