                "delivery with teleconsultation platforms experiencing "
                "substantial spikes in demand, helping patients and care "
                "providers avoid infections and maintain health care services. "
                "Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a "
                "significant opportunity to address persistent health system "
                "challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of "
                "care, while ensuring quality. Objective This study aims at "
                "identifying the determinants of patients’ intention to continue "
                "using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on "
                "information technology use continuance intention and "
                "teleconsultation services. Methods Data was collected in "
                "November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access "
                "to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients’ "
                "intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; "
                "teleconsultation quality; patients’ trust toward the digital "
                "platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and "
                "confirmation of patients’ expectations toward teleconsultation. "
                "We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least "
                "squares component-based technique to test our research model and "
                "hypotheses. Results We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who "
                "had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that "
                "confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on "
                "continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P<.001), followed by "
                "usefulness (total effects=0.587; P<.001) and quality (total "
                "effects=0.511; P<.001). Usefulness (β=.60; P<.001) and quality "
                "(β=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The "
                "confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on "
                "usefulness (β=.56; P<.001) and quality (β=.75; P<.001) in "
                "addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect "
                "effects=0.282; P<.001). Last, quality directly influenced "
                "usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P<.001). Trust does "
                "not play a role in the context under study. Conclusions "
                "Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it "
                "represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery "
                "of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will "
                "help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, "
                "including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so "
