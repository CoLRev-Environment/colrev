            + "decentralization. Moreover, blockchain is founded on the principles of cryptography, which "
            + "provides the required infrastructure for the trust. First application of the blockchain "
            + "technologies is Bitcoin cryptocurrency. After the birth of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies began "
            + "to change financial systems. Learning of blockchain is difficult because blockchain and its "
            + "related technologies are strange for most of the people. In order to figure out blockchain "
            + "technologies, the concepts like cryptography, cryptocurrency, immutable data and "
            + "decentralization should have been understood. Therefore, blockchain and its related "
            + "technologies should be learned through efficient learning mechanisms. Project-based "
            + "learning, team-based learning, active learning and competition-based learning can be "
            + "used for efficient teaching of blockchain. Competition-based learning has been used in "
            + "many areas successfully for years. Smart contract development is the programming part of "
            + "blockchain technologies. In this paper, competition-based learning is applied to blockchain "
            + "programming to increase learning efficiency. In addition, a methodology is presented to "
            + "apply competition-based learning to blockchain programming.",
